When you think of fall, you probably think of winter coming, of raking leaves, and your kids transitioning back to school.
You probably don't think of heaving massive lumps of green slime at friends and family and getting pelted with slimeballs 
during the annual fall slime fest. This year, however, there will be some changes to the festival. The festivities will 
be moved to a large field with two large, slime colored castles on either end. Each castle has three slime-pults on 
top, and all three slime-pults have a variable range of up to 100 feet of the enemy castle. One pult will also be 
able to rotate on its base to attack a 180 degree area.To limit the sheer amount of slime it can shoot, this slime-pult 
takes two minutes to fill with slime, while the other two pults will take only one minute to load and fire. The castles 
also feature a slime gun arsenal and green shields. On top of each castle is a large glass viewing room for those who 
don't want to join the fighting. The entire upgrade was made possible by the county and sponsorers in addition to the 
non-profit company that holds the festival every year. The company is collecting a 25 cent fee per person to keep the festival around 
and to make it even better next year.
