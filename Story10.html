Self-driving trucks are being tested in Ohio’s highways. They are very efficient, 
but include a very expensive GPS. Their main brand is Cena, a company that tries 
to make life easier and more efficient. They transport nearly 50+% of the things 
we buy, yet nearly hundreds of accidents happen each year on American highways. 
Cena is not the only company that makes self-driving trucks.
