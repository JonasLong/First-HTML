<h4>


Recently, many cities in Colorado state have been overun by a flood of evil green beans. 
These evil vegetables are the result of a genetic experiment in which many cloned human 
brain cells were placed inside pea plants. The bean plants grew normally untill they started 
producing beans that literally had minds of their own. The beans, not under any security
escaped the factory and collected twigs which they sharpened on stones, rushing undetected 
into small cities and taking residents by surprise. Lucikily, almost all of the beans were 
rounded up and secured in a holding cell for analysis.

<h4>
Here's what to do if YOU are attacked by a mutant bean:
</h4><h5>
1. Distract them. Place a flashlight or lamp on the floor pointing away from you. Beans love light, so hide in dark places.
</h5><h5>
2. Seek shelter. Find a place at least a foot off the ground where you can stay above the beans.
</h5><h5>
3. Stand up. If you are standing, you can better protect yourself from the beans. Be sure to protect your face form thrown objects.
</h5><h5>
4. Wear foot protection. The beans will fight with twigs, rocks, gravel, and occasionally, fallen comrades.
